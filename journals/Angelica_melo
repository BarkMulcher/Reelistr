Today we worked on creating issues on Gitlab
We realized that using the term lists could be comfusing so instead, users will have 
-"Collections" which will be customized, user-created lists. 
-"Libary" a list of all the movies that the user has watched
-"Watchlist" an empty list provided by the application to which user will add movies they WANT to see from the homepage. 
(i'd say that is our Aha! moment)


Day 5:
We assigned roles so that we can more seamlessly work together as a team and stay on track with our project goals. 
I took notes for the team as I was assigned to be Notetaker:


Established roles to make sure we stay on track to completing our project.
REY: Facilitator
LUKE: Editor
DAN: Progress Chaser
ANGELICA: NoteTaker
We'll set goals for the day
If we find resources weâ€™ll share them onto slack.
Everyone will make an effort to clarify and make sure every one is on the same page, so that at end of day we are clear on what decisions have been made and where we stand on our progress.
Accomplishments:
Merged all journals onto main branch.
Began our design of our API endpoints. Luke was our driver as we discussed what data was needed for each endpoint.
We concluded that we will work in phases. Meaning we will start by making sure our MVP is working and move onto add features (e.g search feature for movies, community forum) moving step by step towards our stretch goals.



Day 4: Took a deeper dive into our wireframes and started designing our API's 



Day 3: Continued doing wireframe design, discussed questions and which database might be better for us to use. 


Day 2: Continued working on wireframing, coming to a better understanding of the project. Began analyzing the data we would receive from the movie datapase api and the type of data that we would be gathering from users. 


Day 1:

We landed on Reelistr for a project idea and developed the design further. We use Letterboxd as inspiration and found the Movie Database api which will be the main api we will use for our project.
