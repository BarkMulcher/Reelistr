Day 1: Got situated with Angelica, Rey, and Dan. We decided on a team name, Terminal Titans, and a name for our app, Reelistr. The app will be a clone of an existing app called letterboxd. Reelistr will allow users to choose movies they've watched, rate them, comment on them, add favorites. It will include an account creation functionality in order to accomplish this.
